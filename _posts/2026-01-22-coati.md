Coati is an iOS app that turns voice memos into clean Markdown notes in your Obsidian vault.

You record a memo, Coati transcribes it, sends the transcript to an LLM for cleanup, and saves the result as a `.md` file directly on your device. The original audio gets saved too, embedded in the note. A backlink gets inserted into your daily note so everything stays connected.

## How It Works

1. **Record** a voice memo in-app
2. **Transcribe** on-device using Apple's Speech framework
3. **Clean up** the transcript with your choice of AI provider---Apple Intelligence, Claude, OpenAI, or Gemini
4. **Save** a Markdown file to your Obsidian vault with YAML frontmatter, the cleaned transcript, and an embedded link to the audio

## Local-First

Everything stays on your device. Transcription happens on-device through Apple's Speech framework. If you use Apple Intelligence for cleanup, that's on-device too---no API key needed, no data leaves your phone.

If you want a cloud LLM for better cleanup (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini), the transcript text gets sent to the API but the audio never does. No account, no cloud sync, no analytics.{% sidenote 1 "See Steph Ango - '[file over app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)'" %}

Markdown files are also easily accessible by Claude Code and other coding agents, so it is easy to include voice memos into your workflow.

## Why "Coati"

A coati is a Sonoran desert animal---curious, resourceful, good at finding things. It does its job without making a fuss.
