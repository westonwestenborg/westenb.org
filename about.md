![Weston Westenborg](/assets/images/profile.jpg){:class="profile-image"}

Hey, I'm **Weston Westenborg**â€”entrepreneur, builder, and lifelong learner. I co-founded [allUP](https://www.allup.world), a new professional social network. Before that, I helped start [Farmscape](https://farmscapegardens.com), an urban farming company, and worked in product at [Ritual](https://www.ritual.com) and Joymode.

I'm originally from Tucson, Arizona, and a huge **University of Arizona basketball** fan. These days, I live near **Portland, Oregon** with my wife and our dog, **Mole**. When I'm not working, I'm usually geeking out over **technology**, playing **pickleball**, or learning something new.
